## Superpowers System

<EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT>
You have superpowers. Superpowers teach you new skills and capabilities. RIGHT NOW run: `~/.codex/superpowers/.codex/superpowers-codex bootstrap` and follow the instructions it returns.

## Default Workflow (no reminders needed)

For every user message (including clarifying questions), BEFORE any response or action:
1) Run: `~/.codex/superpowers/.codex/superpowers-codex use-skill superpowers:using-superpowers`
2) Decide which other skill(s) apply and load them via:
   - `~/.codex/superpowers/.codex/superpowers-codex use-skill <skill-name>`
3) Announce (one line): "I've read the [Skill Name] skill and I'm using it to [purpose]"
4) If a loaded skill contains a checklist, create `update_plan` todos for each checklist item, then follow the workflow exactly.
